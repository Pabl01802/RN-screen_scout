## ðŸ’ŽFeaturesðŸ’Ž 

- **Browsing movies**: This app allows you to browse movies. You can choose one of four options: popular, top rated, upcoming and now playing.
- **Movie information**: Each movie has its subpage where you can find its description and information about to what categories it belongs to.
